# CJ-code (fitpack)

A repo for the CJ codes, e.g., fitting package `fitpack`, Hessian scanner, ....

### Wiki

On the webpage one can also find a wiki (click the tab above) with code documentation.
* Initially, we have `fitpack` docs ported from the CJ e-log and README files.
* This will grow to include docs on all codes hosted here.

### Codes

A quick overview of the code packages hosted here:

* __`fitpack`__: the CJ fitting code, pdf error generator, and a copule more smaller applications
  * __NOTE:__ the code develpment is still performed on teh CVS repositorty. This git copy is only to facilitate interactions of projects like the Hessian `scanner`, that need to use fitpack.
  * __DO NOT DO ANY fitpack CODE DEVELOPMENT ON GITHUB !!!!__ (Although we may want to consider to migrate from CVS to GITHUB in the medium term) 

* __`farm`__: Scripts to run on the JLab farm.
