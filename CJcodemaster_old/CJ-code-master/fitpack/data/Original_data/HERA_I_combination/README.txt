Combined measurement of the inclusive $e+-p$ scattering cross section at HERA
                   
                            --  DESY 09-158 --

Data files contain:

d09-158.nce+p.dat   -- Neutral Current e+p cross sections
d09-158.nce-p.dat   -- Neutral Current e-p cross sections
d09-158.cce+p.dat   -- Charged Current e+p cross sections
d09-158.cce-p.dat   -- Charged Current e-p cross sections

The bin numbers correspond to those in Tables 6-18 of DESY 09-158

Q^2 values are given in GeV^2. x,y are Bjorken x and inelasticity. s_r stands for the reduced cross section. 
F2 stands for the structure function F2. Values 9.990 for the structure function F2 correspond to y>0.6,
where the cross section is significantly sensitive to the structure function FL and thus extraction 
of F2 is not performed.

Errors are quoted in % of the reduced cross sections.

-----------------------------------------------------------
stat           stands for the statistical uncertainty.
unc            stands for the uncorrelated systematic uncertainty.
cor            is the sum of d1-d110 (see below) in quadrature.
exp            is the sum of stat, unc and cor in quadrature.
               Exp stands for the total experimental uncertainty, excluding the uncertainties arising 
               in the combination procedure (procedural uncertainties)
rel, gp, had   are the three sources of the correlated procedural uncertainty
tot            is the sum of exp and rel, gp, had in quadrature. 
               Tot stands for the total uncertainty of the measurement.
d1-d110        are the correlated systematic experimental systematic error sources, they are correlated
               also across the data tables.
