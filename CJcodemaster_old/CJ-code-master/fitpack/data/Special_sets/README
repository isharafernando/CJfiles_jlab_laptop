SPECIAL SETS FOLDER
-------------------

Contains artificial data sets to be used to calculate tehory observables.
This folder to be stored in CVS; the files can be copied or linked to the
parent "data/" folder whenever needed, but the copies or links are not to
be added to CVS.

List of special sets:
---------------------


Gottfried sum rule set [November 2015]
--------------------------------------

*** GSR_data_* = various experimental x,Q^2 bins 
*** GSR_cntr_* = same as above, but Q^2 is bin centered.

They include the kinematics of
1 =
2 =
3 =
4 = BONUS 2014

The files with different suffixes p,n,D are actually identical,
but are useful to separate whatis what in the .out file of a given
calculation.

(Created for analysis of Gottfried sum rule using BONUS F2 data
in collaboration with I.Niculescu, C.Keppel, W.Melnitchouk.)

Can be used for any structure function calculation


Generic DIS calculation sets  (2010-2015)
----------------------------

*** F2_fxtgt = BCDMS-like x binning for F2 data vs. theory 
               summary plot of fixed target data
	       50 Q2 bins logarithmic in [1.7,500] GeV^2

*** test_DN = fine grid in x=[0.01,0.97] deltax=0.01
                          Q2= 2, 5, 10, 50, 100 GeV^2

*** test_DIS = coarser grid in x=[0.1,0.95] deltax=0.05
                               Q2= 3, 5, 6, 7, 12, 20, 50, 100

*** test_d = only 2 bins for debuggingpurposes
             (x=0.3,Q2=2 GeV^2) and (x=0.5,Q2=2.5 GeV^2)

(test_DIS initially used for QHD and isospin dependence of HT studies
with S.Malace, ca. 2010-2011. Extended, modified 2012-2015.)

Can be used for any structure function calculation.
