* The cross section and F2 from Liang's thesis are different from the values in hall C database files. The latter is the re-analyzed (post-thesis) data, and is used as source here.

## Uncertainties:

* norm_c:
 ~~1.9% normalization uncertainty from p146 in Liang's thesis~~ use 1.6% normalization uncertainty according to Eric Christy
* syst_u: 
1.6% point-to-point systematic uncertainty from Liang's thesis, p145
* stat_u:
The original file only provided a combined correlated uncertainties. The statistical uncertainty is pulled out from the total by removing the 1.6% systematic uncertainty ( in quadrature)
