# JLab E94110 Proton F2 from L/T Separation

## Data files: 
  * F2      proton   : [xlsx](../data/JAM/10043.xlsx), [csv](../data/JAM/csv/10043.csv)   
 
## Source: 
f2_e94_110_moddep.dat from Eric Christy's email. 
*The cross section and F2 from Liang's thesis are different from the values in hall C database files. The latter is the re-analyzed (post-thesis) data, and is used as source here.

## Uncertainties:
*norm: 
~~1.9% normalization uncertainty from p143 in Liang's thesis~~, use 1.6% normalization uncertainty according to Eric Christy.

*er_u: 
combination of statatistical uncertainty and the R-model uncertainty( diff b/w two models, see below). the systematic uncertainty is much smaller than rdiff that it is treated as zero.

## Description from original data file:

 Proton F2 structure function extracted from Jefferson Lab Hal C experiment E94-110 cross sections.  

 To minimize the uncertainty on the extrapolation to epsilon = 1, F2 has been extracted using only cross sections measured at epsilon > 0.5.  The uncertainty in the extrapolation has been estimated utilizing what is effectively two different fits to the epsilon dependence of this data set.         

The two fits are:
