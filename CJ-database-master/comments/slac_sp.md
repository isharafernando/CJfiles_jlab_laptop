## Uncertainties:

**norm**: overall normalization uncertainty. 1.7% for Deuteron and 2.1% for Hydrogen. See p76 in ref.

**dST,dSR,dSY,dSE,dN1,dN2** are not listed in the source files. But they are the same as in the corresponding F2 data slac_p / slac_d, and were borrowed from there.

**dRC** is the uncertainty due to radiative corrections. It is given by Equation 3.12 in ref:                             
                                                                                
     dRC = abs[-.014+.017*epsilon]    

## Relative Normalization

**scale** is the relative shift between SLAC experiments introduced when combining datasets. See p76 in ref for details.
