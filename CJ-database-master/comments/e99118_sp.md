The given cross section matched born cross section from F1F209 model. So it should be after radiative correction though it's stated as "before correction" .


## Variables:
See https://hallcweb.jlab.org/disdata/index.html for details.

__epsilon__ is the virtual photon polarization parameter,

__Gamma_v__ is the virtual photon flux factor (in units of Gev-1),

__stat_u__ is the statistical uncertainty,

__syst_u__ is the systematic uncertainty,

__rad1_c__ is the uncertainty from the leading order radiative corrections,

__rad2_c__ is the uncertainty due to the radiative corrections from the Î±2 term.
