# JLab E06-009 Deuteron F2 and R

* Data files: 
  * F2    deuteron : [xlsx](../data/JAM/10041.xlsx), [csv](../data/JAM/csv/10041.csv)   
  * R     deuteron : [xlsx](../data/JAM/10071.xlsx), [csv](../data/JAM/csv/10071.csv)

* First obtained R from L/T separation, then extracted F2 from the cross section given R. 
* F2 data are bin-centered to Q2 = 2, 3, and 4 GeV2.
* R in the database is reconstructed from FL/2xF1


## Uncertainties:
Words from Ibrahim:
(in the raw datafile) f2err_1[j] corresponds to statistical + all p2p systematic uncertainties
summed in quadrature, while  f2sys1[j] etc correspond to correlated
systematic uncertainties due to absolute angle, Radiative corrections and
charge symmetric background subtraction respectively.
